In this game of "Snake" I haven't used any libraries. This game is purely default JavaScript. 

Steps to Run this game:
1. Open the main.html url on Google Chrome.
2. To start the game press any of the arrow keys.
3. You can control the direction of the snake using the arrow keys.
4. You start with 5 pixels as the length.
5. The length increases by one with each yellow pixel(coin) collected.
6. The game resets after the snake eats itself.
